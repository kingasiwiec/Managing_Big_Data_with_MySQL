<i>This course is an introduction to how to use relational databases in business analysis.  You will learn how relational databases work, and how to use entity-relationship diagrams to display the structure of the data held within them.  This knowledge will help you understand how data needs to be collected in business contexts, and help you identify features you want to consider if you are involved in implementing new data collection efforts.  You will also learn how to execute the most useful query and table aggregation statements for business analysts, and practice using them with real databases. By the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of how relational databases work, and have a portfolio of queries.</i>
