-- Exercise 1
-- Output a table that calculates the number of distinct female and male dogs in each breed group of the Dogs table, sorted by the total number of dogs in descending order.
-- Exclude the NULL and empty string entries in the breed_group field, and (2) exclude any groups that don't have at least 1,000 distinct Dog_Guids in them.

SELECT
    breed_group,
    gender,
    COUNT(distinct dog_guid) AS number_dogs
FROM
    dogs
WHERE
    breed_group IS NOT NULL
    AND breed_group <> ''
    AND breed_group <> 'None'
GROUP BY
    breed_group, gender
HAVING
    COUNT(distinct dog_guid) >= 1000
ORDER BY
    number_dogs DESC;


-- Exercise 2
-- Write a query that outputs the average amount of time it took customers to complete each type of test where any individual reaction times over 6000 hours are excluded and only average reaction times that are greater than 0 seconds are included

SELECT
    test_name,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(hour, start_time, end_time))
    AS time

ORDER BY
    time DESC
LIMIT 100;


-- Exercise 3
-- Write a query that outputs the total number of unique User_Guids in each combination of State and ZIP code in the United States that have at least 5 users, sorted first by state name in ascending alphabetical order, and second by total number of unique User_Guids in descending order

SELECT
    state,
    zip,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid) AS number_users
FROM
    users
WHERE
    country = 'US'
GROUP BY

    zip
HAVING
    number_users >= 5
ORDER BY
